# Scikit-Learn Tutorial By Bhupeshwar Pathania
Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python

# Prerequisites
Before we start using scikit-learn latest release, we require the following −

Python (>=3.5)
NumPy (>= 1.11.0)
Scipy (>= 0.17.0)li
Joblib (>= 0.11)
Matplotlib (>= 1.5.1) is required for Sklearn plotting capabilities.
Pandas (>= 0.18.0) is required for some of the scikit-learn examples using data structure and analysis.

# Installation

If you already installed NumPy and Scipy, following are the two easiest ways to install scikit-learn −

## Using pip

Following command can be used to install scikit-learn via pip −

<code> pip install -U scikit-learn </code>

## Using conda

Following command can be used to install scikit-learn via conda −
